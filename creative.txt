For the creative portion, we created a way to register a new user, a way to make a new directory for a user that had
not previously logged on, and a way to create a new file.
The code for registering a new user is found in register.php and simply appends a new username on a new line in user.txt
and then creates a new directory for that user.
The file user-read.php was modified to make a new directory for any user on user.txt that did not have a directory prior to
their first log in attempt.
To create a new file, we used create-new-file.php, which takes in a new file name (with an appropriate extension) and some text data
that will be contained in the file.  The limitation on this function is that it can only create text files because that
is the only type of data that create-new-file.php supports.

TA Login instructions:
If you want to login as a user that already exists in user.txt, login as "dweiner" or "user3"
If you want to login as your own user, create your own username in the register new user spot on our homepage.

Depending on what link you use there will probably be different files in each user's directory.
